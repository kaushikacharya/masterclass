    - Multi-processing & Multi-threading
      - Intuition
      - When and Why to use
    - Python libraries
  - Computer architecture (simplified)  
    - Single core CPU chip:
      - Core and the registers (which holds small size memory)

  - Multi-processing/Multi-threading explanation using mean computation example:
    - Code for mean computation in single core (Slide #5)
    - Trivially parallelize using 2 processes (Slide #7)
      - Using ```Process``` and ```Queue``` from ```multiprocessing``` library.
      - Execution time reduced to close to half.
    - Parallelize using 2 threads, single core (Slide #17) 
      - No significant time difference to simple single core execution.
      - Reasong being the data is already in RAM and hence no I/O execution.
      - Threading is efficient when there's I/O heavy process along with CPU heavy process.
  - Multi-threading architecture introduced by Intel in 90s (Slide #15).
  - Wikipedia diagram describing how a process with two threads executes.
  - Explanation of quiz question on which one can be trivially parallelized (Slide #23):
    - Median computation [No]
    - Standard deviation computation [Yes]
  - Caching (Slide #24)
    - Caching example of a function call repeatedly with same input.
    - Real life usecase: Google search of trending topic
    - Instructor mentioned usage of Redis, Memcache in Amazon search.
  - Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) (Slide #34)
  - GPU architecture (Slide #35)
    - Thousands of cores.
